# Scenario 3 Food ordering app (ADR)

Decision ID: ADR-002
Date: 2023-10-07
Context: We're a team of app developers creating a new food ordering app for a client.

## Decision:  Using Figma for Design (Android) and (iOS)

#### Decision Explanation:
By doing this, we make sure that everything in the app - how it looks, how you move around, and all the buttons - matches what people expect on their phones. It makes the app easy to understand and use for everyone.

- *Simpler Design Process: Figma allows us to design and prototype the app's interface in one place. There are some free design icon such as Icons8, iconscout, dribbble ... ...etc.*

- *Real-Time Collaboration: Multiple team members can work on the design at the same time. This helps us get things done faster and make changes easily.*

- *Preview on Actual Devices: With Figma, we can see how the app will look and work on real iPhones and Androids. This way, we can make sure everything fits and feels right.*

- *Easy Sharing: We can share the design with you and the client so everyone can see how the app will look and give feedback.*


> Note: Using Figma allows us to create a consistent and user-friendly design for both iPhone and Android users without needing to follow different rules for each platform. It simplifies the design process and helps us create an app that works well and looks great on both types of phones..
