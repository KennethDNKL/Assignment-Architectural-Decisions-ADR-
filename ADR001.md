# Scenario 3 Food ordering app (ADR)

Decision ID: ADR-001
Date: 2023-10-07
Context: We're a team of app developers creating a new food ordering app for a client.

## Decision: Building the App - Native Development

#### Decision Explanation:
We decided to build the app using native development. This means I'll create two separate versions of the app, one for iPhones (iOS) and one for Android phones. Here's why:

- *Better Performance: Native development allows us to make the app run faster and smoother. Especially when you're tracking your food orders or using maps.*

- *Access to Phone Features: Like GPS for finding your location and the camera for taking pictures. This makes the app more powerful and useful.*

- *Customized for Each Phone: Making the app works good on iPhones and Androids. Each version will look and work the way properly.*

- *Good for a Long Time: Native apps tend to last a long time and get updates regularly. This means your app won't become outdated quickly.*

> Note: by choosing native development, we're making sure your food ordering app will be fast, work well, and feel just right on your iPhone or Android phone.
