# Scenario 3 Food ordering app (ADR)

Decision ID: ADR-003
Date: 2023-10-07
Context: We're a team of app developers creating a new food ordering app for a client.

## Decision:  Backend Language - Node.js

*Status: Accepted*

#### Problem Statement

We need to choose the backend language for our food ordering app project. The choice of backend language is critical for the performance, scalability, and maintainability of the app.

####  Decision Drivers 

- Need for real-time updates and responsiveness
- Requirement for handling concurrent connections efficiently
- Availability of a large developer community and resources
- Compatibility with selected UI framework (Figma)

####  Considered Options

* [Node.js]
* [Python]
* [Java]


####  Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Node.js", because it aligns with the requirement for real-time updates and responsiveness. It also has a large developer community, which is beneficial for finding resources and support. Additionally, it is compatible with our selected UI framework, (Figma).

####  Positive Consequences

- Real-time updates and responsiveness will be efficiently handled.
- Availability of a large developer community for support and resources.
- Compatibility with the selected UI framework (Figma).


#### Negative Consequences

- we are just learning this method and less familiar with Node.js.

####  Pros and Cons of the Options

#####  *Option 1: [Node.js](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/)*

* Good, because [Efficiently handles real-time updates and concurrency.]
* Good, because [Large developer community and resources available.]
* Bad, because [We are learning on it just in this semester]


#####   *Option 2: [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)*

* Good, because Known for its simplicity and readability]
* Good, because [Easy to work in web development]
* Bad, because May not be as efficient for real-time updates and concurrency.]


#####   *Option 3: [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)*

* Good, because [Well-suited for enterprise-level applications]
* Good, because [Strong in handling concurrency.]
* Bad, because [However, it may have a steeper learning curve compared to Node.js, which can impact development speed and efficiency for our project.]
