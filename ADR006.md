# Scenario 3 Food ordering app (ADR)

Decision ID: ADR-006
Date: 2023-10-07
Context: We're a team of app developers creating a new food ordering app for a client.

## Decision:  User-generated Content - In-house Moderation System

*Status: Accepted*

#### Decision

We've decided to create our own system for checking and managing the comments and ratings that you, the users, leave about restaurants and dishes. This way, we can make sure that what you share meets our quality and content rules.

####  Consequences:

Because of this choice:

- We can be in charge of how we check what you say and make sure it follows our rules.
- We can make changes to this system to fit the needs of our app better.
- We can prevent problems that might come up because of what users share.

> Note: However, this decision requires development and maintenance resources to implement and manage the in-house moderation system.
